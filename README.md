This is my first project for The Odin Project.
We are to create a website that has an index, that links to different recipes.
I am excited to see how I do!

I just fishished up with the lesson. I Got everyting put into the repos-
itory, I tried to keep good git commit notes. I think I did a decent job
for this being my first project for anything like this. This was a blast
to do! I feel super accomplished for getting this done, even though it's
a pretty bare bones website. I know so much more right now than I ever
have about this subject. It's feeling pretty great right now!

I am really enjoying working with Git, and with Linux in general. So
excited to see what happens next!

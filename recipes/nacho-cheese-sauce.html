        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <!-- list of ingredients -->
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons flour</li>
            <li>6 ounces medium cheddar, shredded (about 1.5cups)</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon chili powder</li>
        </ul>

            <!-- list of steps to make dish -->
            <li>
                Add the butter and flour to a small sauce pot. Heat and whisk the butter and<br>
                flour together until they become bubbly and foamy. Continue to cook and whisk<br>
                the bubbly mixture for about 60 seconds.
            </li>
            <li>
                Whisk the milk into the flour and butter mixture. Turn the heat up slightly and<br>
                allow the milk to come to a simmer while whisking. When it reaches a simmer, <br>
                the mixture will thicken. Once it's thick enough to coat a spoon, turn off the<br>
                heat.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir in the shredded cheddar, once handful at a time, until melted into the sauce. If<br>
                needed, place the pot over a <strong>low</strong> flame to help the cheese melt. Do not overheat<br>
                the cheese sauce.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once all the cheese is melted into the sauce, stir in the salt and chili powder. <br>
                Taste and adjust the seasoning as needed. If the sauce becomes too thick, simply<br>
                whisk in a additonal splash of milk.
            </li>
        </ol>
